# Going postal…

…is a workflow for the Mac productivity App [Alfred][alfredapp].  
It helps extract addresses from *Apple Contacts.app*.

[alfredapp]:https://www.alfredapp.com

## Installation and manual

1. Download [current Version (Swift 5)](downloads/Going%20postal.alfredworkflow).
2. Double click to install for Alfred.
3. Invoke Alfred-prompt and type `postal NAME` and wait patiently.
4. Pick one of the results to copy to clipboard.
5. CMD+V address into your editor of choice.

## Older Versions

- [Version for Swift 2](downloads/legacy/swift%202/Going%20postal.alfredworkflow)
- [Version for Swift 3](downloads/legacy/swift%203/Going%20postal.alfredworkflow)

## TODO / Nice to have

- commandline utility not relying on *Afred*.
- backwards-compatibilty to earlier Swift versions within the same file (possible?)
- speed improvements (maybe indexing?)
- Icon needs work
