## Older Versions

- [Version for Swift 2](downloads/legacy/swift%202/Going postal.alfredworkflow)
- [Version for Swift 3](downloads/legacy/swift%203/Going postal.alfredworkflow)

## TODO / Nice to have

- commandline utility not relying on *Afred*.
- backwards-compatibilty to earlier Swift versions within the same file (possible?)
- speed improvements (maybe indexing?)
- Icon needs work
